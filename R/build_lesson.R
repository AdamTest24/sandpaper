#' Build your lesson site
#'
#' This function orchestrates rendering generated lesson content and applying
#' the theme for the HTML site.
#'
#'
#' @param path the path to your repository (defaults to your current working
#' directory)
#' @param rebuild if `TRUE`, everything will be built from scratch as if there
#' was no cache. Defaults to `FALSE`, which will only build markdown files that
#' haven't been built before.
#' @param quiet when `TRUE`, output is supressed
#' @param preview if `TRUE`, the rendered website is opened in a new window
#' @param override options to override (e.g. building to alternative paths).
#'   This is used internally and will likely be changed.
#'
#' @return `TRUE` if it was successful, a character vector of issues if it was
#'   unsuccessful.
