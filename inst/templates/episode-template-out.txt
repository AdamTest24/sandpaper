## Introduction

This is the new Carpentries template. It is written in [RMarkdown][r-markdown],
which is a variant of Markdown that allows you to render code inside the
lesson. Please refer to the [lesson
example](https://carpentries.github.io/lesson-example) for full documentation.

What you need to know is that there are three block quotes required for a valid
Carpentries lesson template:

 1. `questions` These are displayed at the beginning of the episode to prime the
    learner for the content.
 2. `objectives` These are the learning objectives for an episode
 3. `keypoints` These are displayed at the end of the episode to reinforce the
    objectives.

No matter where these blocks appear, they will always be placed at the right
part of the html page.

<!-- TODO: add questions engine to {dovetail} -->

<div class='prereq' markdown='1'>

- How do you write a lesson using RMarkdown with {dovtail} and {sandpaper}?

</div>

<div class='objectives' markdown='1'>

- Explain how to use markdown with the new lesson template
- Demonstrate how to include pieces of code, figures, and nested challenge blocks

</div>

<div class='keypoints' markdown='1'>

- Use `.Rmd` files for lessons even if you don't need to generate any code
- Run `sandpaper::check_lesson()` to identify any issues with your lesson
- Run `sandpaper::build_lesson()` to preview your lesson locally

</div>

<div class='challenge' markdown='1'>

## Challenge 1: Can you do it?
What is the output of this command?

```r
paste("This", "new", "template", "looks", "good")
```

<div class='solution' markdown='1'>

## Output
 

```
## [1] "This new template looks good"
```

</div>


## Challenge 2: how do you nest solutions within challenge blocks?


<div class='solution' markdown='1'>

## Nest Solution
 
You can use the `@solution` tag inside of the blocks to open a nested block.
If you want to close a nested block early, use the `@end` tag, otherwise, it
will be closed at the end of the challenge block.
