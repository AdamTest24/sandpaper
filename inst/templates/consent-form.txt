The Carpentries lesson infrastructure uses the {.pkg renv} (R environment)
package to maintain reproducibility for lessons with generated content. It
looks like you have not yet used {.pkg renv} before, so {.strong this is a
one-time message} that gives you information about how the package cache can
help you with your lesson.

{.renvmessage {RENV_MESSAGE}}

{cli::symbol$arrow_right} This may take some time to set up the first time you use it, but once
the cache is established, the process will run much more quickly.

If you choose not to use the package cache, be aware that you may find
differences between the lesson you render on your computer and what is rendered
online. 

{cli::symbol$arrow} {.strong Do you want to using a package cache for Carpentries lessons?}
