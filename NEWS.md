# sandpaper 0.0.0.9001

* Add `override` argument to `build_lesson()`. This gets passed on to 
  `pkgdown::as_pkgdown()` for more control over where the site gets built.
* Update dependency of {pegboard} to 0.0.0.9006, which includes the $questions
  field to make parsing the ever shifting landscape a bit easier. 
* First tracking version with NEWS
