```{css, setup, echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}
.info {
  display: block;

}
```

The broad idea of the deployment strategy is encompassed in three rules:

> 1. No knowledge beyond markdown and github is required to create a lesson website.
> 2. Any elements of the lesson that need to be rendered will be rendered via continuous integration.
> 3. All changes to the final site are purposeful.

The process for adding an episode to a lesson should take three steps, total: 

1. place Markdown or RMarkdown files in the `episodes/` folder
2. define the order of the episodes in the `config.yaml` file
3. push to github AND/OR preview the website locally with `sandpaper::build_lesson()`

## Why RMarkdown?

We have decided on using the RMarkdown format because it is a VERY powerful
tool that allows you to write code and text without having to copy and paste
output/images/tables. It has [support for several languages including python,
BASH, and SQL](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/language-engines.html).
Most importantly: the code rendering features of it are purely optional; you
can strip away all R-associated content and be left with a markdown document.

This is a system that has already been used for our R lessons for several years
and works fairly well.

## The Two-Step: Building Locally

To preview the lessons, we build the static files locally, without any servers.
While it is possible to go directly from RMarkdown to HTML, we use a two-step
process:

1. Generate static markdown from the source files with a hash of the original
   file in the YAML header
2. Using external style template, generate website HTML from the built markdown
   files

<div class='info'>

NOTE: we need to make sure that we have a renv environment defined for the
lessons, but I think this will need to happen after things are released on CRAN
to avoid maxing out the github api requests.

Now, the first reaction you may have is, "Why do we need a two step process
when we can generate HTML directly from RMarkdown?" The answer is three-fold. 

First, if there is R code in the RMarkdown document, it takes time to execute
the code and add it in to the output document. By having an intermediate
markdown document that contains a hash of the original document, we can make
sure that we only build the files that have changed in content with minimal
overhead in a manner that is compatible with RMarkdown's chunk caching feature.

Second, if any generated element of your page creates invalid HTML, it usually
causes a cascading effect that can be hard to track down if you are looking at
raw HTML output. Having a markdown intermediate allows us to more easily single
out any potential problems. This particular reason is important in the next
section for scheduled deployments where we avoid problems raised explicitly by
checking the output.

Third, having the rendered markdown documents makes them easy to use with other
HTML or pandoc templates not provided by The Carpentries.

You might also be wondering "why aren't the rendered markdown and HTML files
being tracked by git?" The answer is that, they will be, just not on your
computer.

## [i] Deployment (GitHub)

![Diagrammatic representation of the GitHub deployment cycle showing four branches,
gh-pages, md-outputs, main, and my-edit. The my-edit branch is a direct descendent
of the main branch, while the gh-pages and md-outputs branches are orphans. Each
commit of the main branch has a process represented by a dashed arrow that builds
a commit of the subsequent orphan branches](img/branch-flow.svg)

Because some lesson content will be auto-generated from an ecosystem of
software that is constantly evolving, it's important to make sure a few things
are true:

1. The website is always up and available (barring blackouts from GitHub)
2. The style of the lessons can be updated on the fly.
3. The output of the lessons match what the maintainers expect. 
4. Changes in the lesson output is easily auditable via git diff.

Because we have two sources of entropy (software environment needed to build
the lesson content and CSS/HTML/JS needed to create the website), it's
important to separate these steps because if there is a failure, having them
separate allows us to audit the failure and fix the issue on the appropriate
end. Thus, we use the same two-step system we presented earlier in local
rendering, with weekly and monthly checks:

Zooming in on the Pull request workflow we can see that there is only one point
of entry. The box elements represent user interactions, the ellipses are GitHub
workflows. The color indicates permission levels for the workflows. Lavender
workflows only have the ability to check out code and compare it. Wheat/yellow
colored workflows have full permissions to push to the repository:

Because we only track the source files of the lesson and not the output from
the maintainer's computer, we need to rely on Continuous Integration to rebuild
the lesson and deploy it to the cloud. We still use the two-step process here,
but the difference is that we don't want to make any extra commits to the main
branch, so instead of creating the commits in two extra directories, we create
them in orphan branches called `md-sources` and `gh-pages`. The latter is
familiar to most lesson maintainers, and the former serves as a staging and
evaluation area for changes in generated content.

![Dependency relationship between components of the Lesson Template](img/independent-components.dot.svg)

The diagram above describes the dependency graph of the lesson template. Each
component in the graph represents either a file (beige files/folders/documents)
or tools (boxes). The edges (lines connecting the components) are categorized 
with the following labels:

depends
  ~ (e.g. a -> b means component a _depends on_ component b). This is usually
  reserved for lesson artifacts such as generated markdown and HTML. If a
  component is dependent on another component, that means that it can not exist
  without the upstream component. Changes in the upstream component can happen
  independently to the downstream component, but these changes will affect the
  state of the downstream component.

uses
  ~ (e.g. a -> b means component a _uses_ aspects of component b). In this 
  relationship, each of these components are independent and they can change
  independent of one another without necessarily affecting the state of the
  other. 

contains
  ~ (e.g. a -> b means component a _contains_ component b). A component that
  contains another component _must_ change when the contained component changes.
  For example, any changes to the package cache lockfile requires a
  corresponding commit in the source files.

modifies
  ~ (e.g. a -> b means component a _modifies_ component b). Modification occurs
  when a component is the agent of change for a downstream component, but
  changes in the upstream component do not necessarily correspond to a change in
  the downstream component. For example the GitHub Actions component is the only
  one on this graph that can modify other components (including itself), but if
  it were to undergo a change to update frequency, that would not necessarily
  affect the changes that the downstream components see.


### Push to main branch

Each time a commit is pushed to the main branch, the command
`sandpaper::ci_deploy()` is run in GitHub actions and it will render any
changed source files from `main` to `md-source` and then apply the HTML
template, [{varnish}](https://github.com/zkamvar/varnish) to the files in
`md-source` to create the website. 

This process assumes that pushes to the main branch will not break the
rendering process as they will either be cosmetic changes or changes that come
from pull requests (which have previously been vetted). **No extra maintainer
interaction required.**

### Pull requests

Each time a pull request is added, the maintainer should be informed of what
changes in the lesson (if anything), so the process goes like this:

1. A pull request triggers a new branch from `md-sources` called
   `md-sources-{pr#}`.
2. The PR is built into `md-sources-{pr#}`
3. The diff between `md-sources-{pr#}` and `md-sources` is added to the PR
   comments as a link. 
4. Any additional commits to the PR branch will be rebuilt and the changes
   amended to the `md-sources-{pr#}` branch (effectively, a squash merge)
5. Once the maintainer approves the changes, the PR gets merged into master,
   the site is rebuilt from source, and the pr branch is removed.

### CRON: weekly (updating the HTML templates)

As I mentioned above, the HTML templates will not live within the lesson
repository. They will live in the
[{varnish}](https://github.com/zkamvar/varnish) package and applied to the
rendered markdown files. This step will start at the `md-source` branch and
re-apply a fresh version of the template to bring in any stylistic changes that
have occurred in the {varnish} repository (e.g. new CSS rules) in the previous
week. 

This step will test that our HTML template is working correctly. If an error
occurs, we know that we need to fix the HTML template and not the lesson. **No
maintainer interaction required.**


### CRON: monthly (keeping software current)

Because the weekly CRON jobs ensure that the HTML template works, we run the
monthly jobs to make sure the software stack continues to work as expected.
This is important for making sure that the generated output matches the output
that the learners would see and that the narrative additionally matches the
output.

This will explicitly test changes in the lesson due to changes in the software
stack and not the HTML template. Because many of the changes will produce
technically valid output, **Manual inspection of the diffs is required**. There
are six steps in this process, one of which requires a maintainer's input:


1. A new branch is created from `main` with the format `YYYY-MM`.
2. The {renv} configuration file for `YYYY-MM` is reset and a Pull Request is created. 
3. The maintainer follows the regular pull request protocol.
