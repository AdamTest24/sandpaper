title: "The nerd's guide to the lesson toolchain"
---

This document will explore the tools needed to build the lessons and how they
are connected, but it will not go into detail about HOW these work. Before we
start, it's worthwhile to take a step back and analyze what we are doing
exactly. At the very core, we want to be able to take a bunch of markdown
files, translate them to HTML and stick them into an HTML template. This is
also known as static site generation and there are [more than 450 static site
generators available](https://staticsitegenerators.net/).

In the past, we have relied on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which is a
static site generator that has been the back-end engine for GitHub pages for
many years now. The problems we face with this setup are that it was difficult
to update the style of the lesson because it would require a pull request and
often some merge conflict resolution, people would need to have Git, GNU Make,
Ruby, Python, and BASH installed in order to render the lesson locally, and
contributors and maintainers would need to learn the highly specialized
[kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html) and
[liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) template tags.

Our proposed toolchain is designed to be modular and used by both lesson
maintainers and work on the back-end systems with clear requirements. It will
be based on the R programming language and will abide by the following rules:

1. Lesson contributors do not need to know anything about the toolchain to
   contribute in a meaningful way
2. Elements of the toolchain that evaluates, validates, and stylizes should
   live in separate repositories to allow for seamless updating
3. The procedures should be well-documented and generalizable enough that the
   toolchain is not entirely dependent on R.

R is beneficial because it already has a mature ecosystem of packages for
publishing reports and web content from markdown, it works on all platforms,
and we teach it as part of our core curriculum.

Below is a diagram that describes the relationships between different tools in
our proposed toolchain.

## Basic Infrastructure for Maintainers

To manage and render lessons, you need to have the following software
installed. All dependencies for the R packages should automatically install. 

 - Required
   + [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) (>= 3.0.1) and associated packages:
       + [{renv}](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/)
       + [{sandpaper}](https://zkamvar.github.io/sandpaper/)
       + [{varnish}](https://github.com/zkamvar/varnish#readme)
   + [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) (>=
     1.4) OR [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) (>= 2.11)
   + A Modern Web Browser
 - Recommended
   + Git (>= 2.0)
   + [Anconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux) (for Python-based
     lessons)

## The Source of Truth: Dependency Management

Both the Python and the R package ecosystem are constantly evolving, which can
often create different outputs from one maintainer's computer to the other.
Moreover, if you maintain a lesson, you may not want to update a package that
you are using for your thesis work. To alleviate these problems, we will use
the [{renv}](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) R package for managing
dependencies in the lessons.

When you first start R to preview the lessons, if {renv} is not installed, it
will ask you if you want to install it (which you should say yes) and it will
install to your local library. When you build the lesson, {renv} will check
that the specific package versions are installed and if they aren't, it will
install them for you.

<div class='info'>

NOTE: If you have set up any custom prompts for R, working in a {renv} will
temporarily suspend those modifications.

### For Markdown-Only Lessons

If you have a markdown-only lesson with no evaluated code (that is, you copy
and past e the output the learners should see), then you do not need to worry
about dependency management beyond the basic infrastructure (which will be
taken care of automatically).

### For RMarkdown Lessons (R, BASH, Python, SQL)

If your lesson uses RMarkdown to evaluate code and produce output, then it is
of the utmost importance that the dependencies are managed properly in the
lesson. Like the Jekyll-based lesson template, we will take care of making sure
the dependencies are okay, but the only difference here is that we will now ask
you to approve them so that everyone has the same experience. 

While the {renv} package has a relatively stripped-down interface, we wanted to
provide an opinionated solution to management. For example, our learners are
advised to install [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux), which
we also encourage and recommend. 

The {renv} package is aware of both R and Python dependencies, so you can
install and add packages to the lesson as usual and then run a single command
`sandpaper::deps()` to check and update the dependencies. 

Python dependencies will live in an `environment.yml` file at the root of the
lesson.

## Carpentries-Specific Packages

We have created three R packages that were designed to work explicitly with our
lessons. These should be automatically installed by a special configuration
file inside of the lesson repository.

### Lesson Template ({sandpaper})


The [{sandpaper}](https://zkamvar.github.io/sandpaper) package creates and
curates the lesson template. It is the only package that the maintainers of the
lesson template need to interface with. The majority of maintainers need only
one function: `build_lesson()`, which will evaluate all new content and render
it to an HTML page on their local machine. 

#### [i] Key Packages

The {sandpaper} package relies heavily on a few packages internally to make
sure that we do not reinvent the wheel too much and that we gain the benefits
from their tests:

![workflow for sandpaper](https://imgur.com/SpbwuzN.png)

 - [{pkgdown}](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org) provides a scaffolding for us to be
   able to wrap our HTML (translated from markdown) and metadata in a framework
   that can live separately from the lesson template.
 - [{knitr}](https://yihui.org/knitr/) is the engine that we use to translate
   RMarkdown to Markdown without styling the output document. 
 - [{rmarkdown}](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) provides functions that give
   us access to pandoc. At the moment, the only function we use from RMarkdown
   is `pandoc_convert()` to transform markdown to HTML.
 - [{usethis}](https://usethis.r-lib.org) provides user interface functions for
   creating projects and working with github.
 - [{gert}](https://gert.r-lib.org) gives users access to git from R without
   the need for having it installed.

### [i] HTML Template ({varnish})

The [{varnish}](https://github.com/zkamvar/varnish#readme) package contains the
template HTML written in [{{mustache}} templating
language](https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html). It is used by
{sandpaper}, but not explicitly imported so that updating can be done inside R. 

#### Framework

<div class='info'>

NOTE: This section needs more work and information.

</div>

The framework inside {varnish} needs to be extensible and, most importantly,
separate for the logic needed to create the source documents. At the moment, we
are using a [bootstrap version 3](https://getboostrap.org), but [this version
has officially been deprecated for the last two
years.](https://github.com/twbs/release). At the moment, there are two
frameworks widely used within the R community, bootstrap, and
[distill](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/). The benefits of distill is that
it's really nice for including citation metadata, but one of the downsides is
that it absolutely requires JavaScript to be enabled (which can be a security
risk).

### [i] Lesson Validation and Transformation ({pegboard})

The [{pegboard}](https://carpentries.github.io/pegboard) package uses the
[{tinkr}](https://docs.ropensci.org/tinkr) package to read in markdown as XML
and validate the structure against our schema to validate the internal
structure of the lessons.
