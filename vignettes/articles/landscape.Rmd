## Introduction

The new lesson infrastructure has a lot of moving parts, but it is built on a
solid foundation that clearly separates the content from the tooling needed.
Importantly, in order to use the infrastructure, you do not need to know very
much about how it works under the hood. 

Importantly: **this is not a beginner's guide.** If you are looking that 
resource, then head over to [The sandpaper documentation 
site](https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper-docs). This document serves as a
kind of "nerd's guide" to the lesson infrastructure. It steps back and takes a
landscape-level view of how the infrastructure works and how it differs from the
previous infrastructure.

### Motivation

Our lesson maintainers and contributors are all volunteers, which means that
they only have a very limited amount of time to work on lessons. The lesson
infrastructure should be a simple framework for contributors and maintainers to
write lessons in a way that maximizes their attention on the lesson content.

### Difficulties with the previous infrastructure

The [Jekyll-based lesson template](https://github.com/carpentries/styles/) has
been showing its age recently and it's been clear for a while that a refresh is
sorely needed. Chief among the issues with the Jekyll template is that it
currently requires 4 languages (on top of Git) at a minimum to be installed in
order to preview locally: [Ruby, Python, Bash, and
Make](https://github.com/carpentries/styles/issues/480). This setup represents
a large barrier for people who are coming in to lesson maintenance for the
first time and is clearly an issue when [we have to include videos for people
to use a github-based workaround to preview their
lessons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XoEdznJARc).

Beyond the initial setup for contributors, another pain point is the reliance
of the styles inside of the lesson itself and the convoluted manner in which a
lesson must be created: it must be imported from the
[carpentries/styles](https://github.com/carpentries/styles) repository so that
the history is preserved and then the maintainer can initialize the lesson.
When the time comes to update the lesson, we expect that the maintainer has not
touched any of the styling elements or machinery so that the merge happens with
no conflicts, but this is rarely the case and we have to initiate the merge and
fix conflicts.

When we inspect the process of adding or updating content in a lesson, we find
that there are still more places of frustration. The configuration file
contains several pieces of information that are necessary for the site, but
must never be touched. Moreover, the header yaml of the lesson contains three
lists, objectives, keypoints, and questions, all formatted as strings and
included in the body of the rendered lesson. The issue with these is that it's
easy for these to become invalid due to misplaced punctuation. Linking to
images that lived at the top of the repository was difficult and authoring
special block quotes was challenging because writing content always preceded by
`> ` proved to be error prone.

### What the new infrastructure will bring

With the new lesson infrastructure, we strive to clear the template clutter and
allow contributors to focus on what is important: lesson content written in
clear and easy-to-read markdown. Importantly, the lessons will still be portable
and customisable because the engine, validator, and styling will all live in
separate independent software packages. Lessons in the official Carpentries
GitHub accounts will also benefit from automation that will provide timely
updates to the elements needed to build the lessons (in the case for lessons
with generated output). 

This document will outline the aspects of the new lesson template to describe
how it is organized in all aspects including folder structure of a lesson,
content specifications for an episode, content specifications for extra-episode
files (e.g. references), toolchain landscape, local build requirements,
deployment specifications, and internationalization (i18n) specifications.

## Notation

This document is intended to be extensive and is targeted for both lesson
maintainers and the infrastructure team. Because there are overly-detailed
descriptions of the infrastructure that maintainers are not required to know, I
will label these points with `[i]` so that maintainers can skip these sections
if needed.

## Foundation: Structure of the Lesson Template

This section will discuss the structure of the template in terms of file
organization and will not go into the aspects of specific tools. 

The new lesson template is **not** designed to mimic aspects of the previous
template. This template is designed primarily for use in The Carpentries, but
should theoretically be extensible to other contexts. Most importantly,
**contributors should only be expected to know `markdown` and *very* minimal
`yaml` syntax.** in order to contribute to lessons.

Thus, there are a few rules that the new template should follow:

1. The main branch is the source of truth and should be protected
2. Accessibility is a priority for the lesson [based on the WCAG 2.1
   guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/)
3. The style of the lessons should not live in the template
4. The only committed content should be content directly by the
   maintainer/contributor and configuration files
5. Episodes should not depend on the lesson template to be rendered
6. The generated lesson web page should exist as a stand-alone directory that
   can be shared offline

## Accessibility

With a few exceptions, our lessons have shown to be largely accessible thanks
to the reliance on modern frameworks for hosting our lessons. That being said,
there are the occasional issues and the [WCAG 2.1 accessibility
guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/) provides a roadmap to
ensure that our lessons are Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust.

## Lesson Folder Organization

The lesson template will be organized such that it clearly separates the lesson
content from the lesson style:

<div class='info'>

NOTE: I currently have it set up so the extras live in the episodes directory,
but this will change.

</div>

```
|-- .gitignore               # - Ignore everything in the site/ folder
|-- .github/                 # - Scripts used for continuous integration
|-- episodes/                # - PUT YOUR MARKDOWN FILES IN THIS FOLDER
|   |-- data/                # -   Data for your lesson goes here
|   |-- figures/             # -   All static figures and diagrams are here
|   |-- files/               # -   Additional files (e.g. handouts) 
|   `-- 00-introducition.Rmd # -   Lessons start with a two-digit number
|-- instructors/             # - Information for Instructors
|   `-- instructor-notes.md  # -   placeholder
|-- learners/                # - Information for Learners
|   `-- setup.md             # -   setup instructions (REQUIRED)
|-- profiles/                # - Learner and/or Instructor Profiles
|   `-- learner-profiles.md  # -   placeholder
|-- renv/                    # - Local package cache
|-- site/                    # - This folder is where the rendered markdown
files and static site will live
|   `-- README.md            # -   placeholder
|-- config.yaml              # - Use this to configure commonly used variables
|-- index.md                 # - Front page for the site
|-- CONTRIBUTING.md          # - Carpentries Rules for Contributions (REQUIRED)
|-- CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md       # - Carpentries Code of Conduct (REQUIRED)
|-- LICENSE.md               # - Carpentries Licenses (REQUIRED)
`-- README.md                # - Introduces folks how to use this lesson and
where they can find more information.
```

### Episodes

All of the episodes and any content required for the episodes go in the
`episodes/` folder (note no underscore prefix) such that if I were to extract
the episodes folder and give it to someone else, they should be able to execute
the RMarkdown documents in their own project using any method they see fit.


### Configuration

The file `config.yaml` will be a minimal yaml file that contains metadata about
lesson-wide aspects (Author, Carpentry, Licence, Title, etc.) along with
specifications for episodes and extras to be included in the dropdown menus. 

<div class='info'>

NOTE: this may change because of the need to associated TeSS metadata in the
lesson that may become overwhelming if included in a single config file.

</div>

### Generated Files

There are two sources of generated files in the template that are explicitly
**not tracked by git**, which both live in the `site/` directory: the static
markdown cache generated from the source files and the local preview of HTML
files, which are generated from the static markdown files. 

Separating the content generation from the episode from the assembly of the
HTML site gives us a couple of advantages:

1. We can cache the episodes between content generation and HTML styling
2. The tools needed to generate the static markdown documents do not need to be
   the same as the tools needed to apply the HTML template (e.g. it is
   potentially feasible to have a workflow that renders Jupyter Notebook ->
   Markdown instead of RMarkdown -> Markdown).
3. If an error occurs, assess which process was the source of the error does
   not require sifting through HTML diffs.
 
This two step process is explained in [The Two-Step: Building
Locally](#the-two-step-building-locally). 

#### [i] Static Markdown Cache

The static markdown cache of files will live in `site/built` and will contain
static markdown documents with generated output and a special item in the yaml
header called `sandpaper-digest`. The value for this item will be the md5 sum
of the corresponding source file so that the tool chain can determine which
files need to be rebuilt.

#### Local Preview HTML

The local preview of the generated website will live in the `site/docs` folder.
This site is ONLY generated from the static markdown cache in `site/built` and
no other source. 

The `site/docs` folder can be shared anywhere as a fully-functional static
website. Many of the javascript and CSS elements are sourced from CDNs, but
these can also be bundled directly with the site itself (which increases the
size of storage).

#### Portable HTML Lesson

The only thing preventing these lessons from being used offline is the fact
that they rely on the CSS/JS framework being delivered by a CDN, but this may
not be feasible for workshops taught in regions where internet connectivity is
limited (though the browser cache takes care of this for the most part). To
accomodate this, there will be a procedure that creates a standalone folder of
the lesson and writes it outside of the repository so that it can be copied to
a flash drive or delivered via a local WiFi router.

## Episode Structure

All episodes for the Carpentries should be stand-alone markdown documents that
can render to valid HTML via [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) without external
dependencies. The structure of an episode is largely free-form, but there are
certain elements that should be included to ensure a valid episode in the form
of yaml content, required information blocks, instructor notes, and properly
closed fenced div tags.

> As a refresher, a fenced div tag is a line that starts with *at least* three
> colons followed by the name of the tag. The tag is closed by adding another
> line that starts with *at least* three colons with no tag at the end:
>
> ```markdown
> ::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge
> 
> This is a *challenge block*
> 
> ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
> ```


### YAML metadata

The YAML metadata should contain three elements, title, teaching, and
exercises. The `title` is a character string for the title. Markdown can be
used in the title. Both `teaching` and `exercises` are the number of cumulative
minutes required to teach the lesson and complete the exercises, respectively.
This is used to populate the syllabus at the beginning of the lesson

```yaml
title: "Creating Examples: Yes, These *Are* Difficult"
teaching: 20
exercises: 10
```

### Required Information Blocks


 1. Objectives (top) - One to three statements that describes broad concepts
    that the learners should get out of the lesson
 2. Questions (top) - One to three questions for the learners to ask themselves
    before they start the lesson
 3. Keypoints (bottom) - point-by-point reinforcement of what was covered in
    the lesson

> [François, 2020-11-03] When you write (top, bottom) here do you envision to
> enforce the placement of these blocks in the document, or only in the final
> output?

To reduce the amount of friction between what contributors write and what is
displayed on the lesson, placement will be enforced during the validation
procedure and will be validated by checking the proximity of these blocks to
other elements of the document in the XML representation. If the blocks do not
comply, a human-readable alert will be generated indicating where the block is
and where it should be moved (example error):

```
Error:
    File: '/path/to/episode.Rmd'
    
    The Questions block should be at the top of the document (lines AA--BB).
    Instead, they are located at lines XX--YY. Please edit
    '/path/to/episode.Rmd'
    and move the block at lines XX--YY to the top of the document (lines
    AA--BB).
```

### Instructor Notes

Carpentries lessons have traditionally kept instructor notes as a separate page
from the lessons, but this lead to the notes not being used and some confusion
about HOW to use them. It has been proposed that we keep the instructor notes
inside of the lessons themselves at the risk of creating a longer and even more
complicated structure for maintainers to keep track of. To acommodate this, we
propose a new class of tag called `instructor`, which will be hidden by default
and have a toggle that can display the notes alongside the lesson. 

<div class='info'>

NOTE: The question of HOW we will incorporate instructor notes into the
template is still up in the air, but for now, we can at least imagine a
mechanism of including them into the episodes.

</div>

The `instructor` tag will be the same as the other tags, starting with at least
three colons and ending with at least three colons:


```markdown
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

## SLOW DOWN

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

```

### Fenced Div Tags

All open tags must be balanced by a closing tag.

While [the specification](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#divs-and-spans) for
fenced divs are fairly loose, for clarity's sake, we have a few rules of thumb.
Because the tags will not necessarily be color-coded, it's a good idea to
differentiate between these tags with length. It does not need to be any
specific length, but it's a good idea to make sure that the different level
tags should be clearly visible.


1. Instructor tags should be the largest. Aim to have these fences span across
   the document (~80 characters).
2. Top-level tags should span at least half the document (~50 characters).
3. Nested tags (e.g. solution) should span a quarter of the document (~25
   characters).

```markdown
# Lesson 1


This is an example lesson.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

 - Write good 

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

 - Is it okay if the number of colons don't match up?
 - Are the sections visible?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

## Example

This is an example of how you write an instructor tag

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


Let's try a challenge

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

Write a solution

::::::::::::::: solution

NaCl + H2O

:::::::::::::::::::::::
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
```


### Links

For Carpentries Lessons, contributors need to have ways of specifying links
that can access any part of the lesson online or offline. We also need to make
sure that these links preserve the integrity of incoming links because people
who have linked to lessons in the past will not want to discover that their
links are suffering from rot. 

The ultimate goal is to make sure that lesson contributors and authors do not
have to think much beyond what they see in order to create a link. The simplest
way to do this is to have the authors use relative links with an html tag at
the end:

 - Link to other episodes: use `[link text](episode-name.html)`
 - Link to figure for episode: use `![Alt text](fig/figure-name.png)`
 - Link to references in extras folder: `[link
   text](../extras/references.html)`

<div class='info'>

The Jekyll version of the lesson template required Jekyll to be a part of the
process for linking so that contributors would have to write `[link text]({{
page.root }}{% link _episode/01-introduction.md %})`. in order to link to the
episode 01-introduction.

However, most people realized that they could use `{{ page.root
}}/01-introduction/` instead.

That being said, this solution made it impossible to transfer these sites
outside of the context of a Carpentries lesson without manually changing the
links. 

</div>


### Code Blocks

Code Blocks in a lesson are formatted the same way as code blocks formatted in
commonmark. They are represented by three backtics followed by the language you
want to use for syntax highlighting in that block. 


#### Evaluation

Because we are encouraging the use of RMarkdown, you can have code blocks that
actually evaluate code using the RMarkdown chunk syntax of three backtics
followed by a pair of curly braces with the name of the language engine you
want to use for executing the code blocks. 

At the moment, we explicitly support evaluation for R and BASH, but we will be
gathering input from maintainers about processes to expand. 

There is [a large list of language engines that RMarkdown
supports](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/language-engines.html). Most
engines require that you have the language available on your PATH and do not
share variables and values between chunks, so lesson authors will need to be
explicit about the installation requirements for these lessons. Some languages
like Python, Julia, and SQL can share data and variables between chunks with
the help of specific packages (e.g.
[{reticulate}](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate) for Python,
[{JuliaCall}](https://non-contradiction.github.io/JuliaCall/index.html) for
Julia, and [{DBI}](https://dbi.r-dbi.org/) for SQL databases).
