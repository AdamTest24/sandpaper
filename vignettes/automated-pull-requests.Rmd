## Introduction

One of the innovations of {sandpaper} is the out-of-the-box integration with 
GitHub Actions by supplying several workflows that deploy, validate, and update
the lesson. This vignette will focus on the latter set of workflows: those that
update the lesson in some form. In this vignette, we will outline the components
of the lesson that need updating, demonstrate pull requests and the requirements
to set them up on a non-carpentries account, and demonstrate functions to
manually update these components.
