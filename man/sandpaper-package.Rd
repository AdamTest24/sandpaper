\title{sandpaper: Create and Curate Carpentries Lessons}
\description{
We provide tools to build a Carpentries-themed lesson repository into an accessible standalone static website. These include local tools and those designed to be used in a continuous integration context so that all the lesson author needs to focus on is writing the content of the actual lesson.
