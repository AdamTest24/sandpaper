There are `r length(asNamespace("sandpaper")$these$translations$src$varnish)` translations generated by
`set_language()` that correspond to the following variables in {varnish}:

```{r translation-list, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
snd <- asNamespace("sandpaper")
res <- glue::glue("| `translate.{names(tr)}` | `{sQuote(tr, q = 2)}` |", 
  tr = snd$these$translations$src$varnish)
writeLines(c("| variable | string |\n| --- | --- |", res))
```

In addition, there are `r length(asNamespace("sandpaper")$these$translations$src$computed)` translations
that are inserted _before_ they get to {varnish}:

```{r translation-list-computed, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
snd <- asNamespace("sandpaper")
res <- glue::glue("| `{names(tr)}` | `{sQuote(tr, q = 2)}` |", 
  tr = snd$these$translations$src$computed)
writeLines(c("| variable | string |\n| --- | --- |", res))
```
