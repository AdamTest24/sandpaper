If you have source files that require output and figures to be generated
(e.g. R Markdown), then it is important to make sure the generated 
figures and output are reproducible. 

This output provides a way for you to inspect the output in a 
diff-friendly manner so that it's easy to see the changes that occurr due
to new software versions or randomisation.
